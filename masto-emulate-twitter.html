Ok, so.

Tweets look really good when you send them in Messages on iOS/macOS. Mastodon posts… don’t. So I built a little tool that makes them much nicer to look at:

https://mstdn.link

Add ?to={any Mastodon post URL} to the end of that domain and when you send it to a friend, you get the nice looking preview. Of course the page makes it easy to paste a URL in. And there’s a Shortcut to make it even easier on iOS or macOS.    </title>
